Data Of Genomes and Genetics

Downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryarishabh/of-genomes-and-genetics-hackerearth-ml-challenge


Context

Since the dawn of human life on the face of the earth, the global population has been booming. The population was estimated to be 1 billion people in the year 1800. The figure had increased to a new high of 6 billion humans by the turn of the twentieth century. Day in and day out, 227,000 people are being added to the world; it is projected that by the end of the 21st century, the world's population may exceed 11 billion.

As per reports, as a consequence of the unsustainable increase in population and a lack of access to adequate health care, food, and shelter, the number of genetic disorder ailments have increased. Hereditary illnesses are becoming more common due to a lack of understanding about the need for genetic testing. Often kids die as a result of these illnesses, thus genetic testing during pregnancy is critical.
